    "#### This notebook defines the applicability domain of models and computes the pIC50 values for blinded molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology used to define applicability domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We use an ensemble of model predictions  to define the applicability domain.<br>\n",
    "2) In this notebook we use 35 of the best CNN models to create an ensemble of model predictions for each molecule.<br>\n",
    "3) Suppose the models predict x1,x2,...x35 as pIC50 values for a particular molecule.<br>\n",
    "4) We use non parametric confidence interval to choose mid 95 percentile values for pIC50 values.<br>\n",
    "5) The mid 95 percentile values are considered which are symmetric around the median of predictions to reject outlier predictions.<br>\n",
    "6) The median of predictions would be the predicted value of the molecule.<br>\n",
    "7) After choosing mid 95 percentile predictions we are left with 32 predicted values as opposed to the 35 we started with.<br>\n",
    "8) Now these 32 values can be considered as a vector in a 32 dimensional space. Lets call this vector a.<br>\n",
    "9) The median value is repeated 32 times and it too becomes a vector in 32 dimensional space. Lets call this vector b.<br>\n",
    "10) A distance to model metric is defined taking a and b into account.<br><br>\n",
    "distance_to_model = |a - b| / |b| where | | means the magnitude of the vector.<br><br>\n",
    "11) If all predictions are the same then a and b will be the same and |a - b| will 0 and hence distance_to_model will be 0. This would mean that all models are predicting similar values and hence the prediction can be considered reliable.<br>\n",
    "12) On the other hand if a and b vectors are drastically different then |a - b| will be large. This would mean that the models are predicting values which are different and hence prediction cannot be considered reliable.<br>\n",
    "13) |a - b| is divided by |b| to represent the vector difference as a percentage of the magnitude of median vector b. This makes quantifying reliability of predictions independant of the actual magnitudes of a and b vector.<br>\n",
    "14) We decide empirically to fix the cutoff for reliable predictions as distance_to_model <=0.3. We arrived at this number by observing the prediction quality on training and test set compounds.<br>\n"
